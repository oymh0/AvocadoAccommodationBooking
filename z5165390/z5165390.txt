Week 1:

Unfortunately I was absent due to an internship at PwC which overlapped into T1 by one week.

Week 2:

Met my new team members, and connected with them on WeChat. We discussed the proposal which is due the Sunday after week 3. We are planning to make an accomodation booking website, similar to AirBnB. We have delegated some tasks to each of our team members to do. I am responsible for the Aim section of the proposal and some of the epics.
