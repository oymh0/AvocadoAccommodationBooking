Week 1
This is the first week of the term. 
We (SHIQIAN YUAN, MINGHUI OUYANG, LUXIN JIN, TIANCHI YANG) formed a team in the lab on Thursday. 
Then we started discussion about our topic many times and decided to design an accommodation booking web 
finally. Brainstorming is definitely important step in starting a project, then we divide the project into four parts 
so that everyone in our team can participate in the task. In next week, we will find a way how to start our project 
depending on our brainstorming in order to finish the proposal.
