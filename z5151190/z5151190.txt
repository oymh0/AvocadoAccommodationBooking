Work Diary of SHIQIAN YUAN(z5151190)
================================================================================
Week 1
This is the first week of the term. We (SHIQIAN YUAN, MINGHUI OUYANG, LUXIN JIN, TIANCHI YANG)
formed a team in the lab on Thursday. Then we started discussion about our topic many times and
decided to design an accommodation booking web finally. Brainstorming is definitely important 
step in starting a project, then we divide the project into four parts so that everyone in our 
team can participate in the task. In next week, we will find a way how to start our project 
depending on our brainstorming in order to finish the proposal.

week 2
This week we have made a clear plan of how to complete our proposal which contains several parts. 
We divided the proposal to 5 parts which means everyone in our group should hold their responsibility
to do something. About the most important part, Epics, we divided it into 9 module. I write the 
payment support module and the communication service module for properties providers and seekers.
